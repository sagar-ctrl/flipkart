    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Flipkart was founded in October 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, who were both alumni of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and formerly worked for Amazon.[10][11][12] The company initially focused on online book sales with country-wide shipping. Following its launch, Flipkart slowly grew in prominence; by 2008, it was receiving 100 orders per day.[13] In 2010, Flipkart acquired the Bangalore-based social book discovery service weRead from Lulu.com.[14]

In late 2011, Flipkart made several acquisitions relating to digital distribution, including Mime360.com[15] and the digital content library of Bollywood portal Chakpak.[16]

In February 2012, the company unveiled its DRM-free online music store Flyte. However, the service was unsuccessful due to competition from free streaming sites, and shut down in June 2013.[17][18][19][20]

In May 2012, Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer.[21] In May 2014, Flipkart acquired Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for ₹20 billion (US$280 million).[22] Myntra continues to operate alongside Flipkart as a standalone subsidiary; the site focuses on an upscale, "fashion-conscious" market, while Flipkart itself focuses on the mainstream market and major international brands.[23]

In February 2014, Flipkart partnered with Motorola Mobility to be the exclusive Indian retailer of its Moto G smartphone.[24] Motorola also partnered with Flipkart on the Moto E—a phone targeted primarily towards emerging markets such as India. High demand for the phone caused the Flipkart website to crash following its midnight launch on 14 May.[25] Flipkart subsequently held exclusive Indian launches for other smartphones, including the Xiaomi Mi3 in July 2014 (whose initial release of 10,000 devices sold out in around 5 seconds),[26] the Redmi 1S and Redmi Note in late-2014 (which saw similarly accelerated sellouts),[27][28][29][30] and Micromax's Yu Yunique 2 in 2017.[31]

On 6 October 2014, in honour of the company's anniversary and the Diwali season,[32] Flipkart held a major sale across the service that it promoted as "Big Billion Day". The event generated a surge of traffic, selling US$100 million worth of goods in 10 hours. The event received criticism via social media over technical issues the site experienced during the event, as well as stock shortages.[33][34][35][36]

In March 2015, Flipkart blocked access to its website on mobile devices and began requiring that users download the site's mobile app instead. The following month, Myntra went further and discontinued its website on all platforms, in favour of operating exclusively through its app. The "app-only" model, however, proved to be unsuccessful for Myntra (reducing sales by 10%), and its main website was reinstated in February 2016. The experiment with Myntra led to suggestions that Flipkart itself would perform a similar move, but this did not occur. In November 2015, Flipkart launched a new mobile website branded as "Flipkart Lite", which provides an experience inspired by Flipkart's app that runs within smartphone web browsers</p>
